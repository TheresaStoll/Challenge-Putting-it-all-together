#Question 1
#For the Perth station (ID 9225), produce three scatter plots showing the 
#relationship between the maximum temperature and each other measurement recorded 
#(minimum temperature, rainfall and solar exposure).
#Make sure your measurement values are all converted to numeric types with 
#as.numeric(). - in my BOM_joined tibble (that I used), the values were already values (=dbl)  
#To work with just the Perth measurements, make sure to filter() your dataset.

#The only aesthetics you will need to map for this question are x and y. 
#Then, a geom_point() layer will produce a scatterplot of the two mapped values.

#Question 2
#Display these four measurements for the Perth station in a single scatter plot by 
#using additional aesthetic mappings.
#The aesthetics that geom_point() can use are found in the help page (?geom_point)

#One possible solution is to map the temperature data to the x/y aesthetics, 
#the rainfall to the size aesthetic, and the solar exposure to the colour aesthetic.
